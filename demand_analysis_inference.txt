### **📌 Inference from the Line Plot: "Historical Demand Over Time"**
The line plot shows **total volume sold over time**, covering a period from around **2000 to 2023**.These are the inference acheived from the plot:

---

### **1️⃣ Long-Term Trend (2000 - 2023)**
- **📈 Growth Phase (2000 - 2016)**  
  - From **2000 to 2008**, demand steadily increased, with some fluctuations.  
  - A **strong surge from 2010 to 2016**, indicating a period of high demand.  
  - This suggests **rapid industrial growth**, increasing reliance on oil/gas, or favorable market conditions.  

- **📉 Peak & Decline (2016 - 2020)**  
  - Demand **peaked between 2015 and 2017**, reaching its highest point.  
  - After **2018**, a **steady decline** is observed, possibly due to economic shifts, environmental policies, or changes in energy consumption patterns.  

- **📉 Sharp Drop (2020 - 2021)**  
  - A **sudden and steep drop** occurred around **2020**, likely due to the **COVID-19 pandemic** reducing global fuel consumption (lockdowns, reduced travel, economic slowdown).  

- **📊 Stabilization & Recovery (2021 - Present)**  
  - Post-2021, demand seems to **stabilize at a lower level** compared to the peak years.  
  - There are signs of **minor recovery**, but demand remains significantly below the 2015-2017 peak.

### **2️⃣ Possible Causes of Trends**
- **2000-2016 Growth:**  
  - 🌍 Economic expansion, industrialization, and increased energy consumption.  
  - 📈 Growth in the automotive and airline industries.  
  - 🏗️ Infrastructure and development projects increasing fuel demand.  

- **2016-2020 Decline:**  
  - ⚡ Rise of **renewable energy adoption** (solar, wind, electric vehicles).  
  - 📉 Market saturation or geopolitical factors affecting supply chains.  
  - 🌱 Government policies favoring cleaner energy sources (carbon taxes, emissions regulations).  

- **2020 Crash:**  
  - **COVID-19 lockdowns** slashed demand as travel and industry slowed.  
  - 🛢️ Oil prices may have collapsed due to oversupply and low demand.  

- **2021-Present Partial Recovery:**  
  - 🌍 Economic reopening and increased industrial activity.  
  - 🚗 Demand may still be suppressed due to **electric vehicle growth** and **work-from-home trends** reducing fuel usage.  

---

### **3️⃣ Business & Investment Implications**
✅ **If demand remains stable at current levels**, companies should **adjust production capacity** accordingly.  
⚠️ **If renewable energy adoption continues**, traditional oil/gas industries must **diversify into cleaner energy** sources.  
💰 **Opportunities exist** in hybrid fuel markets, alternative energy investments, or supply chain optimizations.

### **🚀 Final Takeaways**
- 📈 **2000-2016:** Strong demand growth  
- 🏔️ **2016-2017:** Peak demand  
- 📉 **2018-2020:** Declining trend  
- 🚨 **2020:** Sharp COVID-19 crash  
- 🔄 **2021-Present:** Recovery, but still below peak levels  



### **📌 Inference from the Time Series Decomposition: "Demand Pattern Decomposition"**  
This decomposition splits the **total demand** into four components: **observed data, trend, seasonality, and residuals**. Here’s what we can infer:

---

## **1️⃣ Observed Data (Top Panel)**
- Represents the **original demand data** over time.  
- **Steady growth until ~2016**, followed by **high volatility and decline post-2018**.  
- **Sharp drops** around **2020 (COVID-19 impact)**, then slight stabilization.  

---

## **2️⃣ Trend Component (Second Panel)**
- The **trend follows the general long-term pattern** of demand growth and decline.  
- **Growth Phase (2000 - 2016):** Clear increasing trend, with a peak around 2015-2017.  
- **Decline (2018 - 2020):** Gradual downward trend, reflecting **reduced industrial demand, policy changes, or economic slowdowns**.  
- **Post-2020:** The trend **remains volatile but at a lower level than the peak**.  

---

## **3️⃣ Seasonal Component (Third Panel)**
- This part should show repeating **seasonal fluctuations** (e.g., yearly or monthly cycles).  
- The **flat, blank-looking graph suggests an issue**:  
  - The seasonal component **might be negligible or incorrectly extracted**.  
  - This could indicate **irregular demand patterns**, external shocks, or a limitation in decomposition settings.  

---

## **4️⃣ Residual Component (Fourth Panel)**
- Residuals capture **random noise or unexplained variations**.  
- Noticeable **low variance before 2016**, suggesting predictable demand.  
- **Large spikes post-2016, especially around 2020,** indicating unexpected shocks (e.g., COVID-19 disruptions).  
- Increasing residual variance suggests **higher unpredictability in recent years**, possibly due to market volatility, policy shifts, or external factors.  

---

## **5️⃣ Key Takeaways**
✅ **Long-term trend growth peaked around 2016-2017, then declined.**  
✅ **Demand became more volatile post-2018**, indicating an unstable market.  
✅ **2020 caused an unprecedented shock, reflected in high residuals.**  
✅ **Seasonality may be weak or improperly extracted, suggesting erratic demand changes rather than cyclical patterns.**  



The scatter plot appears to show the relationship between **Closing Price (X-axis)** and **Volume Sold (Y-axis)**, indicating a **Price vs. Demand** analysis.

### **Observations:**
1. **Inverse Relationship:**  
   - Higher volumes are concentrated at lower closing prices.
   - As the price increases, the volume sold generally decreases, but there are some outliers.

2. **Peak Demand Range:**  
   - Most sales activity happens between **$20-$60**, where volume sold reaches its highest levels.
   - After **$60**, the sales volume declines significantly.

3. **Densely Packed at Low Prices:**  
   - There are many data points clustered in the lower price range (0-20), suggesting frequent trading of low-priced stocks/products.

4. **Outliers:**  
   - A few points exist where high volume transactions occur even at relatively high prices.
   - Some low-volume sales appear across the entire price spectrum.

### **Possible Interpretation:**
- **Demand Elasticity:**  
  The trend suggests **price elasticity of demand**, meaning lower prices drive higher demand.
- **Market Preference:**  
  Most transactions occur within a mid-range price, implying market preference for moderately priced products.
